I'm a lecturer/research assistant professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a postdoc research assistant in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.

My research is based on deep learning, focusing on multimodal learning, large model theory & application, computer vision, data science, *etc*., and has been applied in big data scenarios such as healthcare AI, surveillance AI, and smart government affairs. As the lead author, I have published 10+ papers in well-known AI journals and conferences (*e*.*g*., TPAMI (IF=20.8), TNNLS (IF=10.2), TCSVT (IF=8.3), CVPR, ICCV, ECCV), including six long papers in IEEE Transactions (average IF > 10). My papers received 1300+ citations. One ESI hotspot (Top 0.1%) paper ranks second in the [list of Popular Articles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34) on the TPAMI website. My paper has been awarded the IEEE IC-NIDC Best Paper Award. I organised a special issue for TPAMI as the chief guest editor. As a lead organizer, I have chaired three workshops at top conferences (CVPR 2021 & 2022, ICML 2022). My research has resulted in my designation as the single-PI of a ¥3.5m project and the co-PI of a ¥4.4m one, funded by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology. For industrial applications, I keep close cooperation with the leading technology companies in the practical use of large models.
