I'm a lecturer in Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.
My current research is broadly in multimodal learning, data science, large language models, computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning.
Before joining Tsinghua, I was a postdoc research assistant in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.
